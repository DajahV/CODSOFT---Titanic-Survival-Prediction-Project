# This is an Internship Project from CODESOFT 
This is an internship project I was assigned to by CODESOFT company. 

I use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the RMS Titanic survived the ship wrenck or not. 

The dataset used for this project contains information
about passengers on the RMS Titanic, such as their Names, age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.
