# This is a Data Science Internship I participate in with CODSOFT

In this internship project I built a model that can classify if passengers on the ill fated RMS titanic either survive or died on the ship

I use the Titanic dataset.csv to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the RMS Titanic survived the infamous ship wrenck or not. 

The dataset used for this project contains information
about passengers on the RMS Titanic, such as their Names, age, gender, ticket class, 
fare, cabin, and whether the passenger survived or not.
