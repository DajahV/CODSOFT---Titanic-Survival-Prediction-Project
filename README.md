# This is an Internship Project I Participate in from CODESOFT 
This is an internship project I was assigned to by CODESOFT company.

I use the Titanic dataset.csv to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the RMS Titanic survived the infamous ship wrenck or not. 

The dataset used for this project contains information
about passengers on the RMS Titanic, such as their Names, age, gender, ticket class, 
fare, cabin, and whether the passenger survived or not.
